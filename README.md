# About
This is the code for my personal website, [apurvamehta.com](https://apurvamehta.com). It's a static website that's built with [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and uses the [Bluesky typescript client](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/clients) to display recent Bluesky posts from a given handle.

Since it's static, this site is trivial to host with Github pages or S3 buckets, as well as Vercel and netlify.
